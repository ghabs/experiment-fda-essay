**[DRAFT v0.7]**


## The FDA, COVID-19, and how Institutional Incompetence Exacerbated the Pandemic

This is an incomplete account of how the FDA and the medical establishment completely failed America in fighting COVID-19, and how they actively made the pandemic worse. They prevented individuals and companies from creating and providing timely solutions, causing the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people and trillions of dollars of lost economic output.

This was not a one-off failure of the FDA. Since the modern FDA was created in the 1960s it has [exacerbated epidemics](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0098858817701959) and [slowed life saving medical progress](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1830639?seq=1). COVID-19 cast into sharp relief the systemic inadequacies and costs of the FDA, but even in 'normal' times the existence of the FDA causes a great deal of unnecessary death and suffering.

I’d call this a critique of the FDA, but really, it’s more of a horror story, about a bureaucracy that elevated process over people and followed its internal incentives into catastrophe.

The impetus for this project was a conversation with a friend during that interminable summer of 2020. In the midst of a conversation about the US's pandemic response, I expressed anger at the failure of the FDA, to which he expressed genuine incredulity. "These are some of the smartest people at the top of the medical profession - if they're failing it's because it's a hard problem!" (paraphrasing). 

After some mutual-but-maybe-more-me yelling, on reflection, I understood where he was coming from. The US spends 3.8 trillion dollars a year on healthcare - the kings of the healthcare castle, the people who decide what we can/can't spend that giant pile of money on, are the FDA, many of whom have postgraduate degrees or were doctors themselves. With years of training and a six billion dollar budget, why would I think that they were performing worse than anyone else at managing the pandemic?

My response at the time was to gesticulate wildly, waving my hands around to capture the full length and breadth of the state of the country. But given the magnitude of my claims, I think he deserves a longer answer.

The following series of posts is that response, explaining the FDA, its role in America's response to COVID-19, and how mismanagement and the poor design of the FDA crippled our response.

The main path is the starting point of the argument, while there are ‘notes’ within sections that elaborate and expand upon certain contentions. Over time I hope to expand this to create a truly comprehensive depiction of how good intentions led us to where we are and how we can find our way out.
