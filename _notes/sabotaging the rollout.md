title: Sabotaging the Rollout
---

Developing and approving the vaccines was the first step, but the next step was as important: administering them across the country. Two case stuides in particular demonstrate the tendency of the FDA to innapropriately prioritize their bureaucratic processes over human lives.

**First Doses First**

At the beginning of the rollout there was an administrative choice countries around the world faced; who should receive the vaccine first? While there were major choices to be made around giving it to the elderly or front line workers, there was a hidden assumption that went unchecked for far too long. For the vaccines that required two doses for full effect, should we try and get everyone a single dose first before giving people second doses? 

This was an important question because if a single dose provided enough protection to slow the spread of the virus, then giving more people the virus faster could dramatically cut the time to population level immunity. 

However it was a question that regulators like the FDA were uninterested in. Because the clinical trials had been carried out with two doses, [to change the administration protocol was beyond the pale.](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-statement-following-authorized-dosing-schedules-covid-19-vaccines)

People like [Alex Tabarrok campaigned](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2021/01/first-doses-first-and-herd-immunity.html) for this to be reevaluated, to little success in the US, though other countries like the UK and Canada embraced it. 

Under the default assumptions of the FDA, where a clinical trial requires years to run, it would have been hard to ‘prove’ it. In a crisis a risk-averse actor can always claim deference to the established ways.

This trend continues, with the FDA and others [ignoring the potential benefits of fractional dosing.](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2021/05/fractional-dosing-trials.html)

**Johnson and Johnson**

And there were existing vaccines that were effective with a single dose; for instance, the third approved vaccine, Johnson & Johnson, only required a single shot, and it used a more traditional method of vaccination. The Moderna and Pfizer options were using the novel, mRNA approach - up until March 2021 if you felt concerned about the new vaccination technique you could go with the one that J&J employed.

However, I said up until March 2021, because at that point the FDA decided to be ‘extra cautious’ and destroy the reputation of the J&J vaccine.

After a series of reports of blood clots - [six to be precise](https://archive.ph/Xko5P) - from women who got the J&J vaccine, the FDA paused administration of the J&J vaccine. Millions of potential doses were halted.

Every delay, even by a day, even by an hour, adds up. In return for a pause for the FDA to investigate the blood clotting N number of J&J vaccines sat on the shelf. What did that buy us?

I like the micromort method of evaluating risk - every micromort is 1 in a million chance of dying. So when you do an activity that is risky - pro tip, that’s everything - you incur a certain number of micromorts.

Eight million people got the J&J vaccine - [28 cases in total](https://archive.ph/wip/PClmQ) were identified in people who received that vaccine, with three deaths. That’s a micromort of 0.375. You’d need to inject yourself with 32 J&J shots to approach the risk of a day at the pool.

And of course we’re in the middle of a global deadly pandemic; just existing in America in 2020 exposes you to ~0.5 micromorts from the risk of contracting COVID-19! Orders of magnitude more people would have needed to get sick to justify slowing the vaccine.

While defenders of the pause will frequently bring up that the action was necessary in order to ensure people trust the vaccines, the polling before and after the pause show how much it [actually destroyed public confidence in vaccines](https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2021/04/15/johnson-johnson-vaccine-confidence).

This destruction of public confidence shows up in the vaccination rate before and after the pause.
