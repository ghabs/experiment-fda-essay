title: Rapid Testing
---

Our testing regime was a failure, not just because of these bottlenecks, but because the paradigm was fundamentally flawed. By the time you would get results back, more than likely you’d already have been in the most viral stages of the disease. That’s because the testing that the US conducted was almost entirely PCR based. But we had another option, one we never utilized. Rapid testing.

Rapid tests provide quick, immediate feedback results on the **contagiousness** of a person. If a person is infectious and can spread COVID-19 to someone else, a rapid test will tell you that in minutes. 

And that’s the most important information you need when determining whether to go somewhere, to self-isolate, etc. The sooner someone learns they have COVID the sooner they can self-isolate and reduce transmission.

Not only is their turnaround faster, they could also be significantly cheaper. $1-$10 instead of $100s, cheap enough to be mass produced for everyone in the country.

[Rapid tests were first ‘invented’ in April](https://archive.ph/Yw8eq), but they weren’t meaningfully approved for use until December, and even then only in a crippled, more expensive form. A quick, cheap test that can tell if someone is infectious could have been rolled out across the country. As Michael Mina, an advocate for rapid testing [wrote](https://archive.ph/wN6hG):

> The U.S. government can produce and pay for a full nation-wide rapid antigen testing program at a minute fraction (0.05% – 0.2%) of the cost that this virus is wreaking on our economy.

> ...These tests are incredibly sensitive in catching nearly all who are currently transmitting virus.Widespread and frequent rapid antigen testing (public health screening to suppress outbreaks) is the best possible tool we have at our disposal today—and we are not using it.

> It would significantly reduce the spread of the virus without having to shut down the country again—and if we act today, could allow us to see our loved ones, go back to school and work, and travel

However, these tests were never deployed to their full effect because they don’t fit nicely into the [bed of procrustes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procrustes#Cultural_references) that the FDA enforces.

There was no existing authorization pathway for the FDA to approve a public health test designed for mass use, and so inappropriate standards were applied:

> Requiring public health tools to meet medical device specifications has caused company after company to delay their FDA submissions in a never ending attempt to meet the FDA’s guidelines—The FDA’s persistence to authorize needed public health tools only as medical diagnostics is causing massive confusion among physicians, public health leaders and our state and national governments. 

And a fixation on accuracy meant that the PCR test, with its higher likelihood of detecting viral material, meant that any new tests that fell below that standard were viewed as deficient, despite the fact that they were much better on other dimensions like speed and price.

**It’s easier to notice mistakes of action than inaction. Burning a house down is more noticeable than letting it fall into disrepair. The FDA knows this**, so when faced with the choice between approving something that will be more useful but has a higher error rate, and not approving it, it was safer for them not to approve it. **This is obviously immoral.**

Imagine this. It’s September 2020. Rapid tests are available through a subscription service sent right to your door every day. You feel fine but you decide to go over to a friend’s house and take a test first, and ask them to take one too, knowing with confidence that given the negative result you’re almost certainly safe to hang out. And should you start to feel sick, you can find out quickly and avoid others getting sick.

This isn’t some imaginary future world, this is the kind of technology that could have been available right then! All it would have needed was to **not be illegal**.
