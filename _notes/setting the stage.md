The FDA, or Food and Drug Administration, is a federal agency responsible for approving drugs and medical devices. They also monitor and regulate food safety, but for the sake of this discussion we're only going to focus on the medical part of their remit.

The received wisdom on the FDA is that they're the best of the best. To quote from the FDA website.

> Today, the drug review process in the United States is recognized worldwide as the gold standard.

The FDA as the pre-eminent regulatory board seemed widely accepted as true [tk] (1) (2), and in those halcyon, pre-2020 days, the FDA had an enviable reputation as one of the more trusted federal agencies[tk], and certainly one of the most powerful.

As Daniel Carpenter quoted from one Pharma CEO in the introduction to his excellent book on the FDA:

> The FDA is standing there with a machine gun against the pharmaceutical industry, so you better be their friend rather than their enemy. They are the boss. If you’re a pharmaceutical firm, they own you body and soul.

The FDA as Scarface imagery owes to the fact that the FDA is the sole gatekeeper of the pharmaceutical market. They certify drugs and medical trials, review the data, evaluate the purported efficacy, and can veto and prevent any drug or medical device from being sold in the US. There is little to no recourse if a drug is rejected; if they don't like it, you're done.

And more than their explicit regulatory power, the FDA shapes the culture of medicine and medical science in the United States. Quoting again from Carpenter:

> It is fair to say that the basic terms, standards, schedules, and rules of modern drug development have been fashioned by the [FDA] as much as by any other global entity. When scientists and physicians test a new drug in clinical studies separated by “Phase 1,” “Phase 2,” and “Phase 3”; when companies submit a study “protocol” to the Administration that defines hypotheses and measures before their assessment and use; when firms and physicians debate the “efficacy” and “safety” of a drug before its approval or afterward; when scientists attempt to demonstrate the “bioavailability” of a drug in a given dosage form; when legislators write laws and insurers write policies governing generic drugs that depend upon demonstrations of “bioequivalence”—in these cases and many, many others, human agents are consciously and unconsciously using terms that have been deeply and thoroughly shaped by officials of the Food and Drug Administration.

In essence, through its paramount position in the medical establishment, it sets the tone for public health policy and process.

The FDA gained this position in the wake of the Thalomide scandal. In the early 1960’s the use of Thalomide in Europe to treat the morning sickness of pregnant mothers had severe side-effects, leading to miscarriages and deformities in tends of thousands of pregnant women and newborns. 

 _Horrifying fact - the head of the development of [Thalomide was a nazi war criminal.](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/molecules-to-medicine/from-the-holocaust-to-thalidomide-a-nazi-legacy/)_

While Thalomide was not approved for use in the US, the public outcry in response to the tragedy led to the 1962 [[Kefauver-Harris Amendment]]. Sen Kefauver was chair of the Senate Antitrust and Monopoly subcommittee, and was outraged by the excessive profits of the pharmaceutical industry and the aggressive marketing of drugs. He held hearings on the pharma industry practices, and pushed for greater government control over the manufacture and testing and marketing of drugs.

> At that time, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had limited authority to require efficacy standards or disclose risks. Kefauver was accused of expanding the power of government excessively, interfering with the freedom of doctors and patients, and threatening the viability of the pharmaceutical industry. His legislation seemed likely to fail. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estes_Kefauver)

In the wake of the scandal, Kefauver’s amendment, even though it was not targeted at Thalomide, and even though the FDA was already regulating the safety, was passed. The effects of the amendment were massive - the FDA had to preclear all medical trials, and most consequently it required proof of efficacy that a drug worked. 

Up until that point the FDA was designed to assess the safety of drugs, and certify that there were no adulterants. But after the amendment, they were also tasked with determining whether a drug was efficacious - whether it was effective enough to warrant being available to the public. This dramatically expanded the discretionary power of the FDA, as well as the cost and size of pre-market clinical trials.

This dramatically expanded the discretionary power of the FDA, as well as the cost and size of pre-market clinical trials. Critics of the expansion of the have alleged that this growth has slowed pharmaceutical approvals and acted as a barrier to competition in the pharmaceutical market.

> Peltzman created a statistical model to predict the yearly number of new drug introductions... [it ]tracks the pre-1962 drug market quite well, we have some confidence that if all else had remained equal, the model also should have roughly tracked the post-1962 drug market. Peltzman’s model, in other words, estimates the number of new drugs that would have been produced if the FDA’s powers had not been increased in 1962. Thus, by comparing the model results with the actual number of new drugs, we can draw an estimate of the effect of the 1962 amendments.

Supporters retort that empowering the FDA has prevented companies from taking advantage of people, that slower approvals mean safer approvals, and that the FDA has acted as a champion of good science. [tk links]

In the last year these arguments, and the FDA’s reputation, would be put to the test.
