In our world, **regulatory constraints** set the speed limit for the initial research and development of the vaccine. 

If vaccines had been administered when we already knew they were safe, hundreds of thousands of people would have been inoculated early. We simply lacked the will, or whatever it is that causes some people to not wait weeks to schedule a meeting to approve a life saving drug

Operation Warp Speed was a success, which started to approach what a true wartime process should look like, but it was still lightyears different than the fastest possible process that could have saved the most lives.

The most obvious neglected improvement was human challenge trials - letting individuals volunteer to deliberately infect themselves with the virus and test how effective the vaccine is at preventing infection.

After three to four weeks, needing only a few hundred of volunteers, the world would have had strong evidence on whether a vaccine worked. Depending on the number of participants, different dosage regimes and different exposure levels could be tested, which could have optimized the vaccine protocols (we'd actually know with confidence whether one dose was enough!) Contrast this with the approach that was used, where tens of thousands [tk] needed to participate over months, long enough that researchers can be confident that they can detect statistical differences in the infection rates of the two groups. 

If we had run human challenge trials, we could have known in late spring, early summer that the vaccines worked as well as they did. This would have:

*   Enabled an earlier rollout of vaccines
*   Spurred far greater investment in vaccine manufacturing and distribution
*   Focus efforts and resources on a few vaccine approaches
*   Rally the public to take greater short term precautions with the confidence that vaccines would be coming

The list goes on.

The FDA declared they wouldn’t accept Human Challenge Trials as an alternative method for vaccine development, and as discussed there’s no alternative to the the FDA. 

This despite the fact that the public at large supported the idea - in a survey XX% support human challenge trials. The people who oppose human challenge trials, who cry out it’s not ethical to purposefully infect others, are a closetted group of bioethicists.

In a world where, in April 2020, we had paid a billion dollars to the first group that had run a human challenge trial that met the highest quality of scientific review and published open data backing up all their claims, how long do you think it would have taken for this trial to be run? It only seems like there are too many moving pieces because we have some form of stockholm syndrome from a lifetime of FDA trials taking years; people can move faster than that safely!

The existence of a giant opaque bureaucracy with veto power over changes to process mean that there wasn't a way to experiment with human challenge trials - for activists trying to change things they would undoubtedly needed to lobby a great number of people, none of whom have the power to say yes but all who can say no.

One of the great problems that confront outsiders trying to change systems is that the **system** doesn't have a single face. When you try and change something that is run by a bureaucracy, inevitably you point at one person and they point at someone else and say that's your guy and then you go to that guy and he says 'I'm kind of responsible but actually you need to fill out form D-E in triplicate and then talk to the real guy in charge", and by the end all that energy and motivation to change things has dissipated into the aether.

So its a far greater problem than simply a hidebound FDA that follows the advice of morally deficient bioethicists - though yes, that’s a big part of it - it’s that the FDA as an institution has a terrible incentive structure.
