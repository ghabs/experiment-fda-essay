Right now I’m writing this as we’re learning about a massive spike in India COVID-19 cases [tk link]. Hospitals are overwhelmed, fatalities are likely being under reported, and it seems like the worst case fears, of a collapse of a countries medical system, might come to pass in the worlds second most populous nation.

But I’m also writing this as America starts to return to normal. The disconnect between the two realities is startling, how the pandemic is ending here but is raging at its worst halfway around the globe.

The widespread access to vaccines - and luck - is the cause of these vastly different scenarios. Earlier access to vaccines means America got vaccinating months ahead of India, reducing the number of deaths from regular COVID and sequels to COVID.

Yay us. Except that tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands will die because we were still vastly too slow, because as a world supplier of vaccines the US being slow meant that we started vaccinating later than we had to, which slowed down access for the rest of the world as well.

In the ideal world, vaccines development and rollout would be happening at the speed of the **physical constraints** of manufacturing. Where the number of ‘shots in arms’ at any one time was a factor of the bottleneck of actually producing them. In this scenario our civilization achieved 100% on the test of ‘how do you manufacture a life saving drug in a pandemic’.

That’s not the world we live in.

One of the more galling parts of this slowdown ‘for safety’ is that we didn’t wait to see if the vaccine was safe before administering it, we actually administered another drug called ‘lockdown’. Surprisingly, for an organization and bureaucracy that was very focused on ‘proper testing’, this intervention wasn’t tested by the FDA and the side-effects weren’t evaluated. We can see in hindsight there were many negative consequences:

*   Trillions of dollars of lost economic activity

*   Destruction of human capital and social capital from the loss of inperson ties.

*   However much the general decrease in quality of living from not enjoying the outside world, being with loved ones, missing thanksgivings and Christmas’s and nephews birthdays.

*   A tragic number of deaths.

The list goes on. When it comes to experiments in human freedom, the FDA is more than willing to wing it.

The alternative to approving rapid tests, or making the vaccine available on a voluntary basis, or letting people volunteer to test it (more on that in a second) wasn’t ‘oh we all just wait for this procedure’, it was continuing the lockdown intervention, where 325 million people were forced to take an experimental procedure whether they wanted to or not.
