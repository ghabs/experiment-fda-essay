title: Testing Bottlenecks
---

This failure to test would continue throughout 2020. America drastically underproduced the number of tests that the situation called for. It was common for testing to take days or weeks for results to be returned, if at all [tk: link], at which point an infectious person might have already spread the virus.

There were many proposals to 'flood the zone' with tests, but we never got to the point that they were truly 'available' in such a way that anyone could use them.

When you think of a testing regime, you can imagine it as a manufacturing process. The first step in the process is you notice that you're feeling sick. At that point, you need to decide if you're going to go to a clinic to get tested. Inputs to that decision might be how far away, how much you **think** it will cost, how useful the information will be you get; all factors.

If you end up going to the clinic, you'll then wait in line and, depending on how busy, have your nose swabbed by an attendant. The swab will be mailed to a processing center where it will be combined with reagents and heated to facilitate a chemical reaction that will cause the viral RNA, if present, to multiply exponentially. After several hours there will be enough of it that it can be properly identified as COVID.

This is straightforward, but now multiply that by millions of people trying to get tested. Bottlenecks quickly arose throughout the system. Step back through the process.

*   You needed a **nurse or doctor** to swab your nose and collect the sample, so if they were all occupied swabbing other peoples noses or, you know, treating the sick, you couldn't get your test run.
*   There were a **limited number of processing centers** where the tests could be run, and they quickly got swamped by demand.
*   **Reagents** were in short supply for the reactions. So were **PCR** machines. If either of these weren't available, then the tests wouldn't be run.

Tests would be conducted and, because of these bottlenecks, the results might not come back for days or weeks. That’s too long to wait to find out if you’re actively infecting other people. And because of how limited the testing supply was, there wasn’t the surplus of tests necessary to test people who don’t display symptoms but who might be sick - the asymptomatic spreaders of the virus who likely caused a lot of cases.

Try reading it again but put on these sunglasses first.

- There weren't doctors or nurses available to perform the swab tests because only a doctor or nurse was allowed to swab the inside of your nose. The FDA wouldn't accept a nasal swab test performed by someone with say, an hour of practice in swabbing noses? Seriously, how much do you think you need to practice to get the same performance of an MD in sticking cotton up someone’s nose. I can assure you it doesn't take four years of medical school.
- Only licensed FDA approved labs could run tests, and repurposing existing labs for COVID-19 testing was ‘bottlenecked’ by approvals.
- Reagents and PCR machines were similarly restricted because of FDA regulations on who could or couldn't make chemicals and machines.


If there's a theme emerging here, it's that the **FDA constrained the supply side** of the testing market to such a degree that we were left helpless in the face of the virus. It's like if in WWII after Pearl Harbor instead of mobilizing the car manufacturers to make airplane engines, the government said 'no sorry the waitlist for becoming an airplane manufacturer takes a year, maybe you can get started on the paperwork'.

To borrow a thought experiment from [Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Romer](https://paulromer.net/if-tests-were-sodas/) - imagine if the government regulated drinking straws the way they regulate tests

> People who are thirsty start going to the hospital just to get soda. Doctors comply with their requests for a prescription. Soda producers try to increase output, but soon run into “bottlenecks.” One vendor with an approved soda delivery system that packages a straw with a can finds that its supplier of straws can not keep up with the increased demand. This soda company explains to its unhappy customers that it has FDA approval only for a product that includes a straw from its traditional supplier. The soda company says that it is applying to the FDA for an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) that gives it permission to bundle a can with a straw from a different vendor. As it waits, it keeps repeating its excuse: “There is a straw bottleneck!”

The real question is why, in a world where two billion coca-colas are produced a day, a similar number of tests couldn’t be produced.

And heres the thing - repeatedly I've noticed people reacting to this comparison with something like an aghast shock that the manufacture of life saving tests could be thought of like sugary drinks. But in reality ‘tests being complex’ is a bit like the error the Farmer makes in Charlotte’s Web. The spider writes in her web that it's a pretty good pig, everyone starts thinking the pig is special, except for the farmer’s wife, who accurately notes there’s a magical literate spider in the barn, let’s focus on that.

The special, magical part of a COVID-19 test isn’t the physical components of the test, it’s all of the work and scientific ingenuity that went into the research and development of the tests. The actual components, the physical chemicals and reagents and infrastructure for tests are not in-and-of-themselves that expensive. As Paul Romer goes on to note the true cost of a virus test is $10, not $100.

The government restricts other manufacturers and providers from entering into the market and artificially keeps the price for the necessary components of tests high. So when there’s a demand spike for testing, like during the pandemic, either the price will go up or there will be shortages, with no way for new suppliers to come in and make up the difference.

And frankly, though I hesitate to disagree with a Nobel prize winning economist's economic analysis, I suspect the true price of a test is even lower than that. The returns to scale from having other chemical manufacturers and device manufacturers enter into the market and drive down the output, and different modalities of service that could be provided in a competitive market (i.e. maybe regular people could be trained to swab someones nose and not doctors?) would drive the total cost lower still.
