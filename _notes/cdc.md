__status: a brief aside__

The Center for Disease Control deserves their own rant about mismanagement and failing America when it was needed most. For a brief taste, consider:
- The CDC's test was a failure
- They didn't execute even basic quarantine procedures for passengers who were suspected of having COVID
- They didn't test people who were suspected of having the virus!

From the Premonition, Michael Lewis's book on the pandemic and the virus (by way of [Marginal Revolution](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2021/06/the-premonition.html)):
> Charity had washed her hands of the CDC. “I banned their officers from my investigations,” she said. The CDC did many things. It published learned papers on health crisis, after the fact. It managed, very carefully, public perception of itself. But when the shooting started, it leapt into the nearest hole, while others took fire. “In the end I was like ‘Fuck you’, said Charity. “I was mad they were such pansies. I was mad that the man behind the curtain ended up being so disappointing.” p. 42

But, they're not the focus of this piece because, while they're another example of institutional failure, they didn't create the thicket of regulations that would (is) stifling America's response to the pandemic. The CDC is, in some sense, like a firefighter, and if we're going to understand how it is that America so underperformed our potential, we need to look at the fire marshals, the ones calling the shots.
