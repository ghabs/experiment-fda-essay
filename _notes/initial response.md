## Bungling the initial COVID-19 response

In late December 2019, reports started to emerge of a potentially dangerous virus in Wuhan, China. 

Uncertainty and fear were everywhere, and Chinese officials suppressed the news, treating the potential negative information and the uncontrolled spread of truth about the severity of COVID-19 as a threat. Still, information leaked out as [heroic individuals](https://g.co/kgs/6PYb72) warned of the threat.

In the US epidemiologist mailing lists and slacks were abuzz, and discussion was starting about the likely severity, and the consequences, of this new virus. 

In January 2021 the CDC created a test for COVID-19, and [submitted it to the FDA for approval](https://archive.ph/GMJj8). They approved the test, sending it out into the field.

However, troubling reports started coming in of bad results and bad data - state labs had discovered that the CDC’s test for COVID-19 had [serious performance issues](https://archive.ph/2aM17). 

> By Feb. 8, hours after her lab started verifying the test kits, Rakeman said she began receiving panicked emails from colleagues. Something, they said, was wrong: They had run the tests dozens of times but were getting inconclusive results from two of the reagents, or chemicals, in the vials. Rakeman began calling other labs to see if they were experiencing the same problem, and they said they were. "It was very truly an 'oh, crap' moment," Rakeman said. "These reagents aren't working; everybody is waiting for us all over the city to have this test online. We think we have more cases than we've been able to detect and the test isn't working."

In February and early March it was becoming obvious to everyone that COVID-19 was a problem, but it was unclear where it was, how fast it would spread - all of the pertinent details for organizing the response. The FDA approval of a flawed test slowed all of that down.

But to err is human, to forgive and quickly get another test out, divine. To instead prevent everyone else from getting anything done -- well, now you’re acting like the FDA.

Faced with the failure of the CDC’s test, thousands of people and organizations sprung into action and began working on creating their own tests. Universities, commercial labs, and individual researchers all started to work on solving the testing problem. [tk]

Like in every great film, you can just imagine the montage music as **our plucky hero scientists suit up,** stare at their beakers and lab equipment, and maybe yell eureka as the computer dings and they rush out to let the world know that they’ve found a solution.

But, instead of being greeted as heroes who had stepped in to fill the testing gap left by the failure of the CDC test, they were greeted by a blizzard of paperwork and an icy bureaucracy that made it **_illegal_** to test for COVID-19.

Because the FDA involves itself in all aspects of medical device development, decisions like repurposing a test, or whether a research lab can provide [results to patients](https://archive.ph/yMbPe#selection-2299.0-2299.404), needed to be run past FDA officials.

So groups like the Seattle Flu Study, a group staffed with excellent researchers, physicians, with funding from the state of Seattle and the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation, had to beg for someone inside the puzzle palace of the CDC/FDA bureaucracy to grant them an approval to move forward, to use their functioning tests and functioning labs to learn whether people in Seattle were unknowingly spreading a deadly virus. They were repeatedly denied.

> “We felt like we were sitting, waiting for the pandemic to emerge,” Dr. Chu said. “We could help. We couldn’t do anything.”

As the urgency mounted, the Association of Public Health Laboratories, which represents American laboratories, made an unprecedented request to the commissioner of the FDA to make an exemption so that [state and local public health labs](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-usa-testing/tired-of-delays-u-s-labs-ask-fda-to-develop-their-own-coronavirus-tests-idUSKCN20I2G8?fbclid=IwAR0bR_A6trDC1iKOj48NRE0IfrtQhhTAz-hhi9UCI5XDFtGIcW9IqVy2pX4) could use the tests they had created.

> [the FDA commissioner] responded two days later, saying in a letter that “false diagnostic test results can lead to significant adverse public health consequences” and that the laboratories were welcome to submit their own tests for emergency authorization.

The strongest case for preventing novel tests or new labs from entering into the market, is that a test is introduced that gives the wrong results, either telling people they are sick when they aren't or they're healthy when they're not, which would introduce confusion, misuse of resources, and diminish overall trust in the system. 

But of course the problem is that the determination to prevent bad tests from entering the market must be balanced against the need for tests in a pandemic to be available. There is no 'pause button' to hit while the FDA calculates or the CDC makes a new test; in particular in an exponential pandemic where people are getting sick and infecting others, speed is of the essence.

And the FDA failed to act, as the emergency authorizations would take months. The FDA bureaucrats fiddled with paperwork and continued their normal mode of operation while the country burned.

> Alex Greninger and his colleagues at the University of Washington “spent almost a hundred hours filling out a baroque, thirty-page form, filing the authorization request on February 19th. Still no dice: he had e-mailed the material, and the F.D.A. insisted that he print it out and mail a hard copy, along with the digital file in physical form, such as a thumb drive or a CD, to a separate ‘documentation’ office.” [(New Yorker)](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/04/what-the-coronavirus-crisis-reveals-about-american-medicine)  

This insistence on a lengthy, bureaucratic process was matched by an unrelenting drive to enforce it. This led to insane outcomes where, when researchers tried to sidestep the bureaucracy, they were threatened:

> Later that day, the investigators and Seattle health officials gathered with representatives of the C.D.C. and the F.D.A. to discuss what happened. The message from the federal government was blunt. “What they said on that phone call very clearly was cease and desist to Helen Chu,” Dr. Lindquist remembered. “Stop testing.”

The CDC and the FDA prevented America from ramping up testing when it was needed the most.

COVID-19 was a sharp test of the information processing speed of institutions; given the exponential nature of the threat there was a premium on speed. Responding to the virus a day earlier would have a dramatic impact on the number of future cases. 

Consider the behavior of South Korea’s health officials, one of the first major countries to suffer from the virus.

> A week later, on Jan. 27, the South Korean health officials convened experts and test-kit companies at a conference room inside Seoul Station, an easy central location for experts strewn across the country. They got an early surprise. Two South Korean firms had already begun developing their own tests.

> “We promise a fast approval,” said one South Korean health official at the time, saying the government would buy unused supply if the outbreak never reached a significant size. One firm, Kogene Biotech Co., demonstrated a successful test and got the regulatory green light within four days.

[They mobilized a country wide testing regime in weeks](https://archive.ph/KB3Kw).

Creative solutions to expand access to testing were either never implemented or put into action too late to be useful. [Pooled testing](https://www.hospimedica.com/coronavirus/articles/294781273/israeli-researchers-introduce-pooling-method-for-covid-19-testing-of-over-60-patients-simultaneously.html), an approach for maximizing potential detection of pathogens while conserving the number of tests that need to be run, could have 10xed the number of tests that were. But it was months before it was an approved method. Guidance for pooling only came out in June, with the first approved test + pooling strategy at a federal level a month later. **What were they doing during this time? That’s not for me to know. **By that time, as the NYTimes reported, it was too late:

> But now, when the nation desperately needs more coronavirus tests to get a handle on the virus’s spread, this efficient approach has become worthless in many places, in part because there are simply too many cases to catch

Healthy institutions respond quickly and [[orient]] to new information. They determine whether it's accurate, how much to trust it, and what this implies about the world and the actions the org needs to take. Unhealthy institutions react slower than the events, orienting to the information at a pace that is eclipsed by other actors and by new events. The FDA’s slow response revealed just how sick they are.
