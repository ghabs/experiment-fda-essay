Was this a one-off error, or was the FDA doomed to fail? I posit that they were doomed to fail, because the structure and culture of the FDA was inherently unable to respond effectively against a fast moving pandemic, and in fact is failing 'silently' all the time. 

The dramatic change from the first version of the FDA to the FDA of today involved centralizing power in a single decision structure. This centralization can act as a chokepoint for medical procedures. Should that organization move slowly, or have bad incentives, this affects every actor in the healthcare space, which causes cascading delays.

[TK visualize with a network diagram? Small model that shows how a central chokepoint in a network slows down overall performance.]

Consider COVID-19 tests as the case study. Because there was a single approving organization, delays or vetoes from them prevented new tests from being approved. In most industries, there are multiple gatekeepers, such that there’s implicit alternatives should one group be borked. There was not in this case, which meant when the FDA was slow there was no where else to turn to for approvals and the whole country suffered.

In essence, the FDA is a [[single point of failure]] for our entire healthcare system. A system designed like that suffers from several glaring weaknesses:

- **Lacks Mistake Correction Mechanisms**: A singleton that is biased in one direction or another lacks the corrective force of competing power centers, either providing actual competition such that others can go to them, or by providing more points of view. Multiple approvers with multiple approval routes means there are more likely to be backup products should one be flawed.
- **Doesn't Scale Well**: Singleton patterns are much harder to parallelize. When the FDA was first formed the population of the US was about 85.5 million people. When it was granted supreme regulatory power over efficacy it was 186.5 million. Today the population is 325 million and growing. More than that, the complexity of the United States has grown at a far faster rate. Doubling the population of a country doesn’t necessarily mean it's twice as complex - it’s more like it’s n^2 as complex! There are so many more interactions and so many more connections between people. It's approach might work in a society with ten pharmaceutical companies, instead of tens of thousands of potential providers.
- **Can be Captured**: A single institution controlling a trillion dollar market is ripe for corruption. Critics on both the right and left allege that the FDA is in bed with large pharmaceutical companies, either approving drugs they shouldn't or preventing new startups from entering the market to benefit existing companies.

These weaknesses were very evident in the initial response to COVID-19. They approved a flawed test and there were no alternative routes to get working tests out that didn't run through the FDA and they failed to leverage the full potential of civic society in scaling up testing production through alternative labs or novel testing approaches. ... OK, I don't think the capture charge fits the initial response, but keep reading.

The lesson from the failures of the FDA in testing are we shouldn't have 'certifying' organizations, but that we shouldn't have a single org. Weneed a diversity of approaches and a diversity of organizations! Different groups with different leadership and different incentives, with some degree of competition, such that we’re never again in a situation where a single organization holds the fate of the country in its hands.
