In the end hundreds of thousands of Americans have died over the past year because of a broken institution. There are so many more things to say on this, many of which I’ve barely touched on.

* It’s hard to see the failure of the FDA as anything but confirmation of America as a ‘decadent society’ where institutions are incapable of doing little else but following mechanical scripts.
* How could so much of our government capabilities be hollow without anyone being aware of it? It’s like Warren Buffet says, you only learn who is swimming without a bathing suit when the water goes out - what other parts of our government are naked?
* The political response barely deserves being called a response. It says a lot that orders of magnitude more money could be allocated by congress for economic relief, then was put into scientific efforts to fight the virus.

But I maintain that if we want to understand the failure, we need to look at the root of the problem, which is a bureaucratic entity that has singular power over the medical system and is not competent enough to wield it - in fact, for all the structural reasons laid out, can’t be competent enough to do so. **Monopolies are bad.**

Instead if we want an FDA that is **resilient**, focused on encouraging real discovery and learning, we need a better structure, one that will prevent a similar tragedy.
