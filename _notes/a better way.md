So where is this all going? Perhaps you think I’m going to suggest that we destroy the FDA entirely. I confess to liking that idea, at times. But I don’t think it’s necessary to go that far.

## Repeal the Kefauver Harris amendment

The first suggestion I'll forward, humbly is that we return to a period in time when the FDA worked.

The FDA went sideways when they were tasked with evaluating and approving drugs for efficacy instead of just safety. This ballooned costs, slowed down drug approval, and greatly expanded its control over the pharmaceutical industry in distortionary ways. We can trace the testing and vaccine delays back to this 1962 law that transformed the FDA into a central committee of medicine.

A straight forward fix would be to return to the pre-1962 policy of evaluating for safety. The FDA would continue to require evidence from phase I and phase II clinical trials that drugs are safe before approved, but would not be tasked with deeming a particular drug as effective.

_Q: How would we know if the drugs are effective then?_

There would still be strong incentives for pharmaceutical companies to complete phase III and phase IV clinical trials, to provide evidence to doctors and to insurance companies that the drugs work, otherwise they wouldn't get prescribed or reimbursed. Furthermore, government regulators could still offer certifications of the efficacy of the drugs, on an optional basis.


## Good housekeeping seal of approval

We can think of this as an FDA seal of approval. Given, as the FDA so likes to mention, it's the gold standard for drug approvals, than having an FDA seal certifying that a drug is effective at the FDA’s level would be a major selling point for pharmaceutical companies.

This could also be done by a secondary, separate agency, or a set of private companies which could evaluate the efficacy of the drugs. Similar to the financial markets, private companies could be the certifying accountants of the medical world/

_Q: Why multiple companies/multiple agencies?_

One of the biggest problems with the FDA is the soft coercive power they exercise over the market. There's always the threat that if you piss them off, you're going to find your drug approvals under a great deal more scrutiny. In a world with the FDA performing both functions alone, there would be the threat that the agency could wield to threaten companies that don't go through both (...oh, huh, you don't want to have efficacy testing. Looks like I need a lot more safety testing...)

With competition, where a regulator has to compete against other regulators, this is less likely to happen and they're more likely to balance their interests with those of the market.


## peer regulator approval

When the UK approved the J&J vaccine and the US didn't, why did an American need to solely rely on the wisdom of the US FDA? I personally think people in the United Kingdom can be as smart as Americans, and you know it seems entirely possible that I could trust the judgement of their regulators over the FDA

For the same reasons that I'm allowed to buy Japanese cars, I should be able to buy and use medicine that's approved in other parts of the world.

A critique of the peer approval approach is that there are[ not many efficacious drugs in the world not approved by the FDA](https://archive.ph/S6DBQ) and giving congress a say in the vaccine approval process would politicize the approval process.

This misses the point that it's about encouraging novel innovation and speed - a startup could develop and release in multiple areas, and weakens the singular authority of the FDA.


## progressive approval regime

In a progressive approval regime drugs would be approved after they pass Phase I and Phase II testing for safety, but would continue through later Phase III and Phase IV testing, and market surveillance for side effects and efficacy. This is a slightly weaker version of the pre-1962 proposal - in this case the FDA still has authority over what drugs are in the market, but changes their evaluation methods and biases them towards action and approval, counteracting their natural bureaucratic incentives.

To a certain extent this is already happening - doctors and patients experiment with different pharmaceutical regimes to see the effects of the drug, and provide guidance to other doctors and back to the FDA. (TK: Link)

One thing worth noting about this approach is that it's an important way to assess drugs for treating chronic illness and aging. It's not possible to run a 30 year clinical trial to see if a drug slows the aging process, you need to run this type of experiment live.


## Expand Right to Try

Right to try legislation has been one of the most notable FDA reform movements over the past two decades. Passed in 41 states, and signed into federal law on 2018, Right to Try gives terminally ill patients an option to take drugs that have passed a phase I clinical trial, speeding up their access to potentially lifesaving medicine.

It's a great start; it ratifies a key ethical intuition that access to medicine is context sensitive - someone with different preferences, say because they're suffering from terminal cancer, will be willing to take on more risk than someone who isn't, and the approval system for medicine can and should reflect that.

Of course, we're all dying, every day, and we all have different preferences for risk when it comes to medicine. Expanding right- to- try legislation to cover more cases and to be more of a 'right'.


*   As part of clinical testing, companies should have to agree to provide medicine in right to try cases: One of the deficiencies of current Right to Try laws and implementations is the incentive structure for companies, who need to agree to provide the drug to right to try patients . For the companies, they risk pissing off the FDA or getting negative real world results that could upset carefully managed trials.
*   Expand eligibility for right to try: People with chronic illnesses or severe, even if not life threatening, conditions, should not have to suffer for decades while waiting for more clinical trials to complete. They should be eligible to elect, in consultation with their doctor, to use a new drug.
