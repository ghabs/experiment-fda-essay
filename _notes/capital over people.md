title: Capital over People
---

The FDA’s response to COVID-19 wasn’t an aberration, **it was the FDA working as it’s designed**. A centralized, hierarchical organization of bureaucrats will respond in risk averse, cover your ass ways. No matter how smart or moral the individuals are! The culture of the org dominated.

The FDA took a series of actions that seemed bizarre, both in hindsight and at the time. Incompetence is always a possible answer, and I’m sure it accounts for some of it, but I think it’s unlikely that it’s ‘full on’ incompetence. I think it’s a type of sitcom incompetence where a character is stuck perpetuating an awkward lie to make up for the fact that there's a series of hijinks and shenanigans happening behind the door. (_for more see: every episode of Frasier)._

 In this case the FDA had something to defend, its **institutional reputational capital** among its stakeholders, and so it was consciously and unconsciously choosing to do crazy things because its top priority wasn’t truly to stop the pandemic, but to ensure it’s reputational capital was intact.
