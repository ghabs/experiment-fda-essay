title: Capital over People
---

The FDA’s response to COVID-19 wasn’t an aberration, **it was the FDA working as it’s designed**. A centralized, hierarchical organization of bureaucrats will respond in risk averse, cover your ass ways. No matter how smart or moral the individuals are! The culture of the org dominated.

The FDA took a series of actions that seemed bizarre, both in hindsight and at the time. Incompetence is always a possible answer, and I’m sure it accounts for some of it, but I think it’s unlikely that it’s ‘full on’ incompetence. I think it’s a type of sitcom incompetence where a character is stuck perpetuating an awkward lie to make up for the fact that there's a series of hijinks and shenanigans happening behind the door. (_for more see: every episode of Frasier)._

 In this case the FDA had something to defend, its **institutional reputational capital** among its stakeholders, and so it was consciously and unconsciously choosing to do crazy things because its top priority wasn’t truly to stop the pandemic, but to ensure it’s reputational capital was intact.

 There's an internal calculus, a logic, that drives an organization’s behavior. We call it culture, but I dislike that word because it turns it into this black box of mystery. It’s not some mystical thing. It’s the day to day operating norms and expectations for people within the organization. In healthy, pro-social organizations those norms are aligned with the common good. The choices it guides you to take benefit the organization and the group its trying to serve. 

Think of a generic small to medium sized company with a few hundred employees. They make widgets, they make em for a dollar and sell them for two. They’ve got incentives to sell and make money, but they’re not going to purposefully make bad widgets and try and con people - or even take less dramatic but still shitty actions. They’re embedded in a set of cultural norms that help guide their actions in the right direction.

Contrast this with a company that has gone bad, that has a negative culture, one in which there are few if any pro-social constraints. In this environment the incentives for the company become sociopathic - in particular the incentives of your immediate superiors are prioritized, and concerns about things like the ‘environment’ aren’t so much dismissed as they're never raised, certainly not in some serious way where the relative tradeoffs are deeply interrogated.

It's very natural, and within big organizations like the FDA it's even easier to happen because of dispersed responsibilities. All of the decisions and 'who is on point' gets split among committees of people, which due to the horrible magical spell of committee meetings, invoked by the combination of bad coffee and hierarchies, often end up arriving at worse decisions than a single person. Decisions like the bay of pigs, approving new coke, or waiting 10 days for no reason to approve a vaccine [tk: link]

And with regards to their incentives for an individual actor in the FDA is what will get them promoted (positive) and what will get them yelled at (negative).

The FDA is set up to punish false positives - saying a drug is safe when its not - far more harshly than false negatives - saying a drug is unsafe when its not. And there are few if any meaningful incentives to reward agents for approving drugs faster or doing a cost benefit analysis to see if slightly more risk is worth lives saved.


### Elite Conspiracy

If the FDA was the bottleneck on responding to the pandemic, we’re faced with an interesting question, one that, I will admit, still seems like a mystery to me. In a world of over 7.5 billion people, living in 195 countries, why is there a near uniformity of approach in medical regulation? 

While different countries have slightly different approval processes, and some seem more on the ball, the general structure and incentives remain the same.

Defenders of the FDA will say this is evidence of the superiority of the FDA; that we tried other methods and the world found the one that works. Despite its drawbacks and the fuckups it’s the best one around.

But the unanimity is suspicious - it's like hearing from someone who ended up in the suburbs of Stepford and is looking at all the identical smiling faces and saying 'gosh this place must be perfect, look how everyone has agreed to live the same way, no horrible secret underneath that's for sure. When unanimity exists around a topic as complex as institutional design, when every country organizes itself the same way, we should expect that it's less the byproduct of experimentation and reasoned design and more the outcome of mimicry.

Medical regulators don't exist in a vacuum, where they from first principles design a drug approval process. They exist in a world with peer countries and professional networks sharing information and opinions on 'best practices'. Remember, the incentives for any regulator in this set up are 'don't approve dangerous medicine' and 'be well-regarded'. There are systems that already exist that you can look at and copy and boom, checkmark on both of those. And if you don't do it, well you're almost suggesting that the existing systems don't work. Expect to get slammed at your next conference.

This is not a slight against the regulators - this is a human thing! Almost all companies have the same structure because if you're making a new company you've already got a hundred ways your company can fail - do you want to add 'tried new organizational scheme where everyone reports to everyone' to the list? Even if it's a good idea, you've got limited weirdness points to spend. Better to copy the structure of organizations that exist which you can be sure work well enough.

You look at the history of regulation and you see a similar pattern play out around the world in 20th century - the US adopts a policy, good or bad, and later its often copied by other countries.

They're all running the same incentives and the same design, so we shouldn't be surprised they end up in the same place making the same terrible regulatory judgements. We should be more surprised when a few don't - where places like Israel elevate human judgement over cover your ass processes, or Slovakia tries novel rapid testing policies.

Because, for the most part, everywhere in the world we're being regulated by the same type of person.
