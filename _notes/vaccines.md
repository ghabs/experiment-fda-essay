title: Vaccines
---

Of course I’m writing this in 2021, as the fastest vaccine development process ever carried out has turned the tide and saved lives. Vaccines are a triumph, an incredible achievement of modern science. I’m genuinely astounded when I hear that with the technology we have today that a vaccine to a deadly plague can be created and synthesized in days. If ever there was a Science, Fuck Yeah moment, its that.

But, to paraphrase a [famous quote](https://archive.ph/wip/GcsKq), we have god-like technology for creating medicines and medieval institutions for deciding whether you get to take it.

Put bluntly, the vaccines were a triumph only in that people overrode the default instincts and approach of the FDA. They were a triumph over the bureaucratic morass that normally accompanies approvals of new medical technology. The heroic effort to get a vaccine developed and distributed in a year is a **massive rebuke **to an organization that was - even after the initial [vaccine had already been developed](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/12/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-design.html) - talking about an 18 to 36 month timeframe for vaccines to be rolled out.

Even still, the FDA managed to make decision after decision that cost time, money, and lives, in a truly impressive attempt to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.

The overarching framework, when evaluating the performance of the FDA when it comes to vaccines, needs to be viewed in the context of a pandemic where two to three thousand people were dying every day, and where we could be extremely confident that number could spike due to any number of heterogeneous factors (seasonal factors, new variants, etc.). From this point of view speed is far in front of the rest of the pack. It needs to be safe, it needs to be effective, but it needs to be here now.

The FDA repeatedly added stumbling blocks to the process, trying to turn operation warp speed into operation '30mph is good enough for government work'. Their day -to- day operations betray a culture that couldn't truly get behind moving fast and prioritizing speed of development. 


### Some Examples

**AstraZeneca**

The AstraZeneca trial was paused in September after someone in the clinical trial fell sick from a neurological illness, Transverse Myletitis. This is the second time they paused, when they paused in July due to another patient falling sick.

Of course, people falling sick is important to investigate - the FDA wouldn't be doing its job if they didn't try and determine the cause of illnesses among study participants. What if it caused people to get sick??

The actual incidence was 2 out of 18,000 people who were administered the vaccine; of those one had a chronic illness that causes an increased risk of TM, and the other didn't have details released. So in typical FDA fashion they did so in a manner that paused research, slowed down the vaccine process, and took multiples longer than other regulators that were running similar trials. 

> With 18,000 data points, a “1%” risk would require there to be 178 missed cases. Odds of that are astronomically low. Much more likely, if there were any real correlation (which again seems rather unlikely) we are looking at something 80+) and would STILL result in fewer deaths than waiting.

And, we must meditate on the fact that study participants in the control groups were **still getting sick from the deadly pandemic** they were exposed to, so the longer they took the more people were getting sick!

It took [tk x weeks/months] from when they were allowed to resume by UK investigators for the FDA to allow trials to resume. Only in[ October were they allowed to continue](https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-vaccine-trial-from-astrazeneca-oxford-can-resume-in-u-s-11603476923). In that time peer regulators, from Japan to South Africa to the UK had resumed the trials, with tens of thousands of data points that could have informed the safety estimates and factored into the costs of delaying a vaccine.

The most shocking example of this bias towards slowness to delay is how, at the finish line, when Pfizer submitted their data for final review and approval, it took the FDA several weeks to book the approval meeting.

> Pfizer submitted data detailing the safety and effectiveness of its vaccine on Nov. 22. But rather than immediately convening experts, the FDA scheduled a review meeting on Dec. 10, almost three weeks later. As Pfizer’s application sits on the shelf at the FDA awaiting authorization, about 27,000 Americans will have died. So what is the FDA doing for three weeks?

Before this final review, they had slowed the process down even more, by pressuring [Pfizer to change its analysis requirements](https://archive.ph/GPY4v) for examining phase III clinical trial data:

> Pfizer’s trial protocol .. [allowed] for a check of interim results once 32 participants developed Covid-19. It was a lower benchmark than Moderna and the other companies had adopted and F.D.A. regulators warned Pfizer they were highly unlikely to issue an emergency use authorization for a coronavirus vaccine based on such a small data set

>In their announcement of the results, Pfizer and BioNTech revealed a surprise. The companies said they had decided not to conduct the 32-case analysis “after a discussion with the FDA.” https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/09/covid-19-vaccine-from-pfizer-and-biontech-is-strongly-effective-early-data-from-large-trial-indicate/

>The FDA’s surprise October decision to require more follow-up data for vaccine trials than they do for other drugs conflicts with the FDA’s regular process.

This pushed the vaccine release date back another month! During the period when the vaccine could have been approved, COVID deaths were the leading cause of death in the country.

**Q: I heard that was to prevent it from being politicized for the election - we wouldn’t have wanted Trump or Biden to use that to get elected.**

If that’s true, then an unelected group of bureaucrats decided tens of thousands of lives, the people that died in the interim while we waited for a vaccine, was worth hiding information from the American public to affect the outcome of a national election.

… yeah, sounds plausible
